# Task 1: Arithmetic Operators


Create two variables a and b with numeric values.
Calculate the sum, difference, product, and quotient of a and b.
Print the results.

a = 10
b = 5
sum_result = a + b

difference_result = a - b
product_result = a * b
quotient_result = a / b
print("sum:", sum_result)
print("difference:", difference_result)
print("Product:", product_result)
print("Quotient:", quotient_result)

# Task 2: Comparison Operators
Compare the values of a and b using the following comparison operators: <, >, <=, >=, ==, and !=.
Print the results of each comparison.

a = 10
b = 5


less_than = a < b
greater_than = a > b
less_than_or_equal = a <= b
greater_than_or_equal = a >= b
equal = a == b
not_equal = a != b
print("a < b:", less_than)
print("a > b:", greater_than)
print("a <= b:", less_than_or_equal)
print("a >=:", greater_than_or_equal)
print("a == b :", equal)
print("a != b:", not_equal)

## Task 3: Logical Operators
Create two boolean variables, x and y.
Use logical operators (and, or, not) to perform various logical operations on x and y.
Print the results.


x = True
y = False

and_result = x and y
or_result = x or y 
not_result_x = not x
not_result_y = not y

print("x and y:", and_result)
print("x or y:", or_result)
print("not x:", not_result_x)
print("not y:", not_result_y)

# Task 4: Assignment Operators
Create a variable total and initialize it to 10.
Use assignment operators (+=, -=, *=, /=) to update the value of total.
Print the final value of total.
