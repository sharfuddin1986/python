# Task 1: Arithmetic Operators

Create two variables a and b with numeric values.
Calculate the sum, difference, product, and quotient of a and b.
Print the results.

a = 10
b = 5
sum_result = a + b

difference_result = a - b
product_result = a * b
quotient_result = a / b
print("sum:", sum_result)
print("difference:", difference_result)
print("Product:", product_result)
print("Quotient:", quotient_result)

# Task 2: Comparison Operators
Compare the values of a and b using the following comparison operators: <, >, <=, >=, ==, and !=.
Print the results of each comparison.
